# CPC ZERO

A hypothetical 6502 based Amstrad CPC computer.

The Amstrad CPC was originally intended to be based around a 6502 CPU but the designers couldn't deliver. A new team where brought in and the world got the Z80 based machine we know and love. However a prototype PCB for the 6502 based machine is still in existence.

This repository is the design for what the 6502 based computer might have been, drawing inspiration from both the prototype PCB and the final Amstrad CPC464.

You can follow the design and build process on my blog using the CPC_ZERO tag: https://bread80.com/tag/cpc-zero/
